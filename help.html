The interface consists of words and word clusters.
Words and words clusters are nodes in a graph. The words
are reachable from the left-size menu by drilling down by their first-letter.
The clusters are presented on four pages and are reachable by their numbers.

One may observe that:

- clusters are relatively disjoin
- the words used are mostly nouns
- clusters are linked to related clusters
- clusters have a word list associated with them
- there are some errors, but it looks like those are related to the respresentation of words as vectors. This representation comes from Glove.
- if one represents words by multiple vectors each for their single meaning the results would be better

The goal is to show how to navigate a graph of data points which are well-connected and the data points are of relatively
small dimension.
